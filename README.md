## Demo versions

There are two demo builds included in the package, and you should be sure to check out the one that is appropriate to your work.

### solr-7

The `solr-7` branch will contain release 2.0 and is compatible with Drupal 7.69, 8.81, and Solr 7. It relies on Search API Solr 8.3, and will be Drupal 9 compatible.

This branch uses Search API Federated Solr version 8.x-3.x. All new development is done on this branch.

### solr-4

The `solr-4` branch contains release 1.0 and is compatible with Drupal 7.69, 8.81, and Solr 4-6. Most important, it relies on Search API Solr 8.1, which is no longer maintained. This branch is stable and appropriate for deployment to Acquia, provided your site is not using Solr 7.

This branch uses Search API Federated Solr version 8.x-2.x. No new development is expected on this branch and it is not expected to be Drupal 9 compatible.

## Development Environment

The development environment is based on [palantirnet/the-vagrant](https://github.com/palantirnet/the-vagrant). To run the environment, you will need:

* Mac OS X >= 10.10. _This stack may run under other host operating systems, but is not regularly tested. For details on installing these dependencies on your Mac, see our [Mac setup doc [internal]](https://github.com/palantirnet/documentation/wiki/Mac-Setup)._
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
* [virtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) >= 5.0
* [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) >= 2.8 `brew install ansible`
* [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 2.2
* Vagrant plugins:
  * [vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
  * [vagrant-auto_network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network`

If you update Vagrant, you may need to update your vagrant plugins with `vagrant plugin update`.

## Development Environment Components

The development environment inside the virtual machine will be automatically configured by Vagrant.

You may be interested in creating your own development environment and comparing it against the tested version.

* Operating System: Ubuntu 64bit version 16.04.4 LTS
* Web Host: Apache HTTP version 2.x
* Database: MySQL version 5.7.21
* PHP version 7.3.9
* Search Server: Apache Solr version 4.5.1
* Web Application: Drupal versions 7.69 and 8.8.1

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project from github: `git clone git@github.com:palantirnet/federated-search-demo.git`
2. From inside the project root, run:

  ```
    vagrant up
  ```
3. You will be prompted for the administration password on your host machine
4. Log in to the virtual machine (the VM): `vagrant ssh`
5. Build, install, and enable demo content: `phing install-all`
  * When prompted, you may choose to empty the current SOLR index. This action is recommended when re-installing all sites, but not one site.
  * If you wish to install without Domain Access, run `phing install-no-domain`. In that case, two sites will be built with 20 pieces of content.
6. Visit your D8 (standalone) site at [http://d8.fs-demo.local](http://d8.fs-demo.local)
7. Visit your D8 (domain access) site at:
   - [http://d8-1.fs-demo.local](http://d8-1.fs-demo.local)
   - [http://d8-2.fs-demo.local](http://d8-2.fs-demo.local)
   - [http://d8-3.fs-demo.local](http://d8-3.fs-demo.local)
8. Visit your D7 site at [http://d7.fs-demo.local](http://d7.fs-demo.local)
9. Visit your D7 (domain access) site at:
   - [http://d7-1.fs-demo.local](http://d7-1.fs-demo.local)
   - [http://d7-2.fs-demo.local](http://d7-2.fs-demo.local)
   - [http://d7-3.fs-demo.local](http://d7-3.fs-demo.local)
10. View the Solr index at [http://federated-search-demo.local:8983/solr/#/drupal8/query](http://federated-search-demo.local:8983/solr/#/drupal8/query).
11. See the bare React app (without Drupal) at [http://react.fs-demo.local](http://react.fs-demo.local)

You can log in to any of the Drupal sites at `/user` with `admin/admin`.

## How do I work on this?

You can edit code, update documentation, and run git commands by opening files directly from your host machine.

To run project-related commands other than `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh`:

* SSH into the VM with `vagrant ssh`
* You'll be in your project root, at the path `/var/www/federated-search-demo.local/`
* You can run `composer`, `drush`, and `phing` commands from here
* Go to the path `/var/www/federated-search-demo.local/web/*` to add new modules to each site.
* Use drush on the D8 sites - try `drush site:alias` or `drush @d8 status`
* Use drush on the D7 site by navigating into the d7 directory:

   ```
   cd web/d7/
   drush site-alias
   drush @d7 status
   ```

* Use drush on the d7-domain sites by navigating into the d7-domain directory:

    ```
    cd web/d7-domain
    drush site-alias
    drush @d7-domain status
    ```


## Working with content

This version of the demo site is all about dogs. We use simple core content types (basic page and article) supplemented by taxonomy terms. The content titles are meaningful (they are all dog breeds). Content body is lorem ipsum text.

We create three vocabularies in Drupal 7:

* Age
* Color
* Traits

In Drupal 8, the Color vocabulary is not present. This difference shows how sites with different taxonomies can be integrated in search results.

Each content page is assigned to the available vocabularies. This setup allows our search index to provide filters by each term.

Note that term mapping in Federated Search lets you alias terms. In the Drupal 7 version, the Color `Gold` is aliased to `Yellow` in the search index, so both terms appear as filters. Likewise, the Drupal 7 term `Affectionate` is mapped to `Loyal`, matching the term from Drupal 8, so only `Loyal` appears in the filter. These configurations show how disparate taxonomies can be merged in the search index.

### Images

Some of the dogs -- but not all -- have images. These show how the index handles image display. The following dogs should have images: `Irish Terrier, English Terrier, Newfoundland, Pointer, Greyhound, Dachshund, Maltese, Cumberland Sheepdog, Dalmation, Toy Spaniel`.

Note that sometimes the image cache must be primed, so if you see a broken image on first page load, reload the page. If an image has the url `default`, it means the index has not been built properly. Run `phing solr-reindex` to correct the issue.

Images are [public domain](https://freevintageillustrations.com/faq/) and sourced from [Free Vintage Illustration](https://freevintageillustrations.com/vintage-dog-illustrations-public-domain/). They are intended for demonstration purposes only.

## Sample searches

By default, the sites will show all content when no search keywords are entered. There should be 32 items in the default result set.

* Domain 1 - Drupal 7 (3 results)
* Domain 2 - Drupal 7 (2 results)
* Domain 3 - Drupal 7 (3 results)
* Drupal 7 - Federated Search (10 results)
* Federated Search Domain 1 (2 results)
* Federated Search Domain 2 (2 results)
* Federated Search Domain 3 (3 results)
* Federated Search Drupal 8 (10 results)

Note: Theses numbers add up to more than 32 because some content is assigned to multiple domains.

If you did not install the domain sites, then there will be 20 items:

* Drupal 7 - Federated Search (10 results)
* Federated Search Drupal 8 (10 results)

A good sample search is for `terrier`, which should return 5 results (4 without domain support):

* English Terrier (D7)
* Jack Russell Terrier (D8)
* Irish Terrier (D7)
* Boston Terrier (D8)
* Norfolk Terrier (D8 Domain 1)

These four search results should be identical:

* http://d8.fs-demo.local/search-app?search=terrier
* http://d7.fs-demo.local/search-app?search=terrier
* http://d8-1.fs-demo.local/search-app?search=terrier
* http://d7-1.fs-demo.local/search-app?search=terrier

## Reading the SOLR index

With the VM running, you can visit the SOLR index at http://federated-search-demo.local:8983/solr/#/drupal8/query to see indexed data. When looking at an item indexed by federated search, compare it to this sample:

```
        "id": "dqiuue-federated_search-1",
        "index_id": "federated_search",
        "item_id": "1",

*Bonus example*: The sample above shows how the `Yellow` and `Gold` colors are stored as synonyms in `sm_federated_terms`.

## Drupal Development

You can refresh/reset your local Drupal site at any time. SSH into your VM and then:

### Rebuild all the things

If you just want to get up and running, from the project root run `phing install-all`. If this fails for any reason, proceed to run it step by step.

### Run each step individually

1. Download the most current dependencies for D8 (standalone): `composer install --working-dir=web/d8`
2. Download the most current dependencies for D8 (domain access): `composer install --working-dir=web/d8-domain`
3. Download the most current dependencies for D7: `composer install --working-dir=web/d7`
4. Download the most current dependencies for D7: `composer install --working-dir=web/d7-domain`
5. Reinstall Drupal 8:
   - Standalone: `phing install-d8 -Ddrush.root=web/d8/docroot`
   - Domain site: `phing install-d8-domain -Ddrush.root=web/d8-domain/docroot`
6. Reinstall Drupal 7: `phing install-d7`
   - Standalone: `phing install-d7 -Ddrush.root=web/d7/docroot`
   - Domain site: `phing install-d7-domain -Ddrush.root=web/d7-domain/docroot`
7. Build the `/src` directory and checkout modules there: `phing init`
   - This links each of the two modules: `search_api_federated_solr` and `search_api_field_map` from the D8/D7 single site docroot to the `/src` directory and also into the D8/D7 Domain Access-enabled docroot. This means all changes made in `/src/search_api_...` will propagate to both sites simultaneously. The `phing init` command is run automatically by any of the installer scripts. These git checkouts point to GitHub and have `drupal` aliased remotes to drupal.org (`git remote show`).

### Clear the search index

If you rebuild the Drupal sites you might end up with orphaned content in Solr. To clear:
`phing solr-clear`

To clear and re-index all content:
`phing solr-reindex-all`

### Updating Solr config

This project is currently using [Solr v4.5.1](http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/ref-guide/apache-solr-ref-guide-4.5.pdf).

The source for Solr config can be found at `conf/solr/drupal[7/8]/custom/`, based on your site's core (`drupal7` or `drupal8`).

These files were copied from the `search_api_solr` module and updated to meet testing needs for this project.

As part of provisioning this box, the custom Solr config from `conf/solr/drupal[7/8]/custom/` will be copied to the directory where Solr expects its config to live (`/var/solr/drupal[7/8]/conf/`).

Once you've made an update to a config file in `conf/solr/drupal[7/8]/custom/`, you'll need to reprovision your vm using `vagrant up --provision` if your vm is not already up or `vagrant provision` if your vm is already up.

### Restarting Solr

You can restart the Solr service from the project within the vm with `sudo service solr restart`.

## Working with styles

The default CSS for the search application page can be overwritten by a local file. See the Federated Styles module included in the Drupal 8 project for an example.

`/web/d8/docroot/modules/custom/federated_styles`

## Testing without using Drupal

If you prefer, you can see the app running as pure HTML in the browser. The URL http://react.fs-demo.local will load the Federated Search application, showing how cross-site search can be run as a standalone service.

To run this app, configure it with `phing react`. This command will copy two files that you may edit.

Change the configuration of the application by editing the file:

`/web/react/app/settings.js`

Edit the CSS of the application:

`web/react/app/custom.css`

You will still need to build and index content using Drupal to populate the search index.

## Automated Behat testing

Since the function of the application is to search across multiple sites, Behat is our best method for testing.

You can run Behat tests with `phing behat` or `vendor/bin/behat --tags=javascript`. You may need to start the selenium service first with `phing start-selenium`.

The settings for Behat are in `/behat.xml` and tests are in the `/features` directory. These tests run against the default Drupal 8 installation (http://d8.fs-demo.local).

## Directory structure

This repo is structured a little differently than usual, since it contains 4 independent Drupal docroots. Here're some important pieces:
